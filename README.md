This is an old fun python repository of mine. Speak with an artifical "girlfriend" using Azure Speech and OpenAI.

### Usage
Clone or download repository and change the config.json.

You need to change the following keys:
- openai_key - A key can be generated on the [OpenAI API Platform](https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile?tab=api-keys).
- azure_key - A key can be generated in the [Azure Speech Service](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
- azure_region - The region can be found on the same page as the Azure Key.

After that just start the script or use the run.bat file.
